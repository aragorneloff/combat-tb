### Drug-resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and associated risk factors among multi drug-resistant tuberculosis suspected patients from Ethiopia

Multidrug drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major health problem and seriously threatens TB control and prevention efforts globally. Ethiopia is among the 30th highest TB burden countries for MDR-TB with 14% prevalence among previously treated cases. The focus of this study was on determining drug resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among MDR-TB suspected cases and associated risk factors.

A [new paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197737) by Mesfin et al in [PLOS One](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197737) reports on
a GeneXpert MTB/RIF based study of patients infected with drug resistant TB.
