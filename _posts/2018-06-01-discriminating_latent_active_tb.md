### Novel M. tuberculosis specific IL-2 ELISpot assay discriminates adult patients with active or latent tuberculosis

Tuberculosis (TB) still is a major worldwide health problem, with 10.4 million new cases in 2016. Only 5–15% of people infected with M. tuberculosis develop TB disease while others remain latently infected (LTBI) during their lifetime. Thus, the absence of tests able to distinguish between latent infection and active tuberculosis is one of the major limits of currently available diagnostic tools.

A [new study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197825) by Bella et al in [PLOS One](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197825) evaluates the
LIOSpot® TB anti-human IL-2 ELISpot assay for distinguishing between latent and active TB infection.
