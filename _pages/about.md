COMBAT-TB (the Computational Bacterial Analytical ToolKit for Tuberculosis) is a
[South African Medical Research Council](http://www.mrc.ac.za/) and
[National Research Foundation](http://www.nrf.ac.za/) funded project 
undertaken by researchers and software developers at the South African
National Bioinformatics Institute (SANBI) that provides tools for understanding *M. tuberculosis* (Mtb). Our focus is on two related initiatives:

1. The COMBAT-TB [eXplorer](http://combattb.sanbi.ac.za). an comprehensive
knowledgebase of the Mtb genome and associated information on known drug
targets, drug resistance mutations, protein structure, biological
pathways and more.

2. The COMBAT-TB Workbench, a set of tools and workflows for Mtb sequence
data analysis. These include workflows for variant calling, variant
annotation (integrated with the eXplorer) and phylogeny construction. We are
using the [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) platform for our workflows
to ensure that they are reproducible, re-usable and available to all TB
researchers.

We practice open science and open source software development.
